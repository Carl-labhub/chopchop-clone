Prerequisites:

Chopchop uses bowtie for mapping and twoBitToFa to retrieve sequence information. Both these programs, must be downaloaded and put in the users PATH.
bowtie 1.0.1  -   http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie/1.0.1/
twoBitToFa  -  http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/

To query by gene name, CHOPCHOP will need a table to look up genomic cooridinates. The webserver uses a database, but the batch version currently only supports flat files downloaded from UCSC:
They can be downloaded from the UCSC table browser: https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start
1. Select organism and assembly 
2. Select Genes and Gene Predictions
3. Select RefSeq Genes 
4. Select refFlat 
5. Select  Genome" 
6. Select output format: all fields from selected table -> file name: danRer7.UCSC_table -> get output

2bit compressed file  -  http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html  -> select organism -> full data set ->  download *.2bit  where *= e.g. danRer7 (or assembly name equivalent)

Python  -  Macs come with Python, but not necessarily the latest version. https://www.python.org/download/

Biopython module  -  http://biopython.org/wiki/Download


Steps:

1. Make fasta version of genome   -> run twoBitToFa  on *.2bit file

2. Make bowtie compressed version of genome:    (using your new fasta file)  Instructions: http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml#the-bowtie-build-indexer

3. Create a genomes directory - should contain: .2bit genome file, bowtie (.ewbt) genome files and .UCSC_table file

4. Make sure bowtie and twoBitToFa and the genomes directory are in your path

5. Run CHOPCHOP!
